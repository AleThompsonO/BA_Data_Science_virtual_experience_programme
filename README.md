# British-Airways---Forage---Data-Analytics

This repository contains two tasks related to data analysis for British Airways.

## Task 1

The first task involves scraping review data from the web using Skytrax. Once the data is collected, it must be cleaned and prepared for analysis. Techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or wordclouds can be used to gain insights into the content of the reviews. The results of the analysis should be presented in a PowerPoint slide.

## Task 2

The second task involves exploring and preparing a dataset to train a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will make a booking. New features should be created and the performance of the model should be evaluated using cross-validation and appropriate evaluation metrics. The results of the analysis should be presented in a PowerPoint slide.
